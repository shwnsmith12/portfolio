<h3>Description of Project</h3>
The idea behind this application is to create a personalized profile for myself to showcase my skills in Web Development. As my skills grow I will update the profile to show what I have learned. I want to use this page to show a prospective employer my skills, and also to take a guage of what I need to focus improve myself in failing categories.
